# A little about me 🤔

## Hello there 🇧🇷
I'm a brazilian computer science student, at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of São Paulo (IFSP).

### What I'm doing 👨‍💻
Well, I do have some personal projects here and there, but my main focus right now is at the college stuff.
You can check any of my previous projects' repositories (some of them are jokes, but there are some serious ones as well) on my profile.

### Interests 💭
My main personal interests are aviation, astronautics, politics, science as a whole, art and gaming.
For the technology stuff, I'm into video game development, simulations, and operating systems.
